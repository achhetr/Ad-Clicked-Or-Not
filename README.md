## Ad-Clicked-Or-Not

Let's consider that I am working for a marketing company. 

This problem assumes that my company is running marketing campaigns. <br>
Our task is to predict which customers will most likely click on the ad.<br><br>

We assume that you have an online marketing campaign for which you spend 1000 AUD per potential customer.<br>
For each customer that you target with your digital ad campaign and that clicks on the ad,
let’s assume that you’ll get a net profit of 100 AUD. Your task is to come up with a model
that will maximize the profit of the company. 

This problem is a part of [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fayomi/advertising/version/1#advertising.csv) competition but data sets have been cleaned by @Jean-Sebastien (DSDJ Mentor).

Process:
We developed based model to evaluate the performance of the data. We could see that with base model<br>
it produced 97% accuracy using Random Forest Classification model. 


Future work:
Needs to perform hyper tuning and optimise the model.
